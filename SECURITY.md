## Guidelines
We require that all researchers:

1. Abide by this policy to disclose vulnerabilities, and avoid posting vulnerability information in public places, including GitHub, Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.
2. Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems (including but not limited to networks using the affected software), and destruction of data.
3. Keep any information about vulnerabilities that youâ€™ve discovered confidential between yourself and the engineering team until the issue has been resolved and disclosed.
4. Avoid posting personally identifiable information, privately or publicly.
5. If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to: -
* Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research on this vulnerability.
* Work with you to understand, resolve, and ultimately disclose the issue in a timely fashion.
